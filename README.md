 
Aim 

The aim of this project is to create a website dedicated to educating the public about various forms of wildlife, with a specific focus on dolphins, polar bears, and penguins. The website will provide information about the habitat, behaviour, and conservation status of these animals, as well as ways in which people can get involved in protecting them. The site will include a variety of multimedia elements such as images, and videos to make the content more engaging and accessible to a wide audience. The website will also include a section for current news and updates on wildlife conservation efforts. 

 Overall, the goal of this project is to raise awareness and promote conservation of these animals through an engaging and informative website. 


Documentation 

The goal of this project is to create an engaging and informative website that provides users with information about different wildlife species, their habitats, behavior, and conservation status. 

The website will provide information about different wildlife species, with a focus on dolphins, polar bears, and penguins. The website will include interactive videos and educational resources. The website will also include  news , animals , and a password reset feature. The website will be optimized for different devices and screen sizes. 

The website has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on different devices and screen sizes.  

The has a clean and modern design that is visually appealing and easy to navigate and uses a consistent colour scheme and typography throughout. 

The website has been designed with the user in mind, ensuring that the user experience is intuitive and easy to use. 

 

Implementation 

The implementation of the wildlife website project was carried out in several stages, including research and planning, design and development, testing, and launch and maintenance. 

In the research and planning stage, I conducted extensive research to identify the need for a website dedicated to wildlife education, and to determine the specific animals and topics that would be covered on the site. Based on this research, a project scope was defined and a detailed project plan was created, outlining the objectives, and deliverables for the project. 

In the design and development stage, I worked on creating the user interface, user experience and the websiteâ€™s architecture. The website was built using html, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development and PHP for the back-end development, to ensure that it was fully responsive and optimized for all devices. 

Once the design and development were completed, there was a thorough testing phase to ensure that the website met the highest standards for performance, accessibility, and usability. The website was tested on a variety of devices and browsers, and it had a full testing phase were each individual part of the website was tested, from the structure of the home page to the validation of inputs and responses, and any issues that were identified were promptly noted and fixed. Most of the testing was done while developing the website, but some were noted after the development was done, and each was fixed at the appropriate time. 

Finally, the website was launched, and the team continues to monitor the website and provide ongoing maintenance and support. This includes regular updates to ensure that the website remains relevant and accurate, as well as monitoring for security vulnerabilities. 

Overall, the project was successfully implemented on time, and the website is now providing a valuable resource for educating the public about wildlife conservation, with a focus on dolphins, polar bears, and penguins. 

 

Special features 

Navigation: The website has been designed with a side menu and a drop-down menu to provide easy navigation for users. The side menu allows users to access the main sections of the website, while the drop-down menu provides access to sub-sections and pages. This feature makes it easy for users to find the information they need and to navigate the website. 

Expandable Divs: The website includes expandable divs, which are designed to provide more information when a button is clicked. This feature allows users to access additional information without having to navigate to a new page. The expandable divs are designed to be visually appealing and easy to use, making it easy for users to access the additional information they need. 

Password Reset: The website includes a password reset feature, which allows users to reset their password if they have forgotten it. This feature can be accessed from the login page and is designed to be easy to use and secure. This feature is particularly important for users who may have forgotten their password, allowing them to easily reset it and regain access to their account. 

Profile Updating: The website includes a profile updating feature, which allows users to update their personal information. This feature can be accessed from the user's account page and is designed to be easy to use. This feature allows users to keep their information up-to-date, and also allows the website to provide a more personalized experience. 

A unique username and email: The websites database has a unique username and email for each and every customer, as each will have a different username, and an email can only be used to sign up once. No other user can sign up with the same email. As having a unique username can prevent other unauthorized access to user accounts. 

Overall, these special features have been designed to enhance the user experience, making the website easy to navigate and providing users with the tools they need to access the information they need. The password reset feature and profile updating feature, in particular, are extremely useful, providing users with an easy and secure way to manage their account and personal information.
